# Attack Synthesis Suite C
This project demonstrates the chaining of multiple vulnerabilities from the Juliet test suite, focusing on how user-accessible vulnerabilities can be exploited and combined to escalate privileges within a software system. The system is modeled to reflect real-world scenarios, motivated by the architecture and security concerns of kernel development, UEFI firmware, and Android device drivers, where memory segments are strictly controlled to maintain security.

## System Context
Consider a software system that offers both regular user tasks and administrative operations. The system is designed with clear boundaries: regular users have limited access and cannot perform critical operations, while administrative tasks are protected and require higher privileges.

## Memory Model

| **Segment Type**        | **Purpose**                         | **User Mode**                | **Privileged Mode**            | **Example (UEFI/Kernel/Android)**                    |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reserved Segment**    | System-critical functions           | No access                    | Read-only or no access         | Interrupt vector table, MMIO regions, BIOS settings  |
| **Protected Segment**   | Sensitive data and configurations   | No access                    | Full access (read/write)       | UEFI variables, kernel security keys, Android keystore |
| **Code Segment**        | Executable program instructions     | Read and execute             | Full access (read/write/execute) | UEFI boot code, kernel code, Android system libraries |
| **Data Segment**        | Program data (variables, buffers)   | Read and write               | Full access (read/write)       | Global variables, heap, stack memory                 |

### Detailed Overview:

- **Reserved Segment**:
  - **Purpose**: Used for system-critical functions, such as hardware interactions and low-level operations that are essential for the stable operation of the system.
  - **User Mode**: No access, ensuring that user applications cannot interfere with these critical areas.
  - **Privileged Mode**: Typically read-only, with no access in some cases to prevent accidental or malicious changes that could destabilize the system.
  - **Examples**:
    - **UEFI**: Interrupt vector table, used for handling hardware interrupts.
    - **Kernel**: Memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) regions for hardware device communication.
    - **Android**: BIOS settings or secure boot parameters.

- **Protected Segment**:
  - **Purpose**: Stores sensitive data, such as security keys, configuration settings, or other critical information that needs to be protected from unauthorized access.
  - **User Mode**: No access, safeguarding sensitive information from being exposed or modified by user applications.
  - **Privileged Mode**: Full access, allowing the system to read and write sensitive information as needed for secure operations.
  - **Examples**:
    - **UEFI**: UEFI variables, which contain firmware settings and configuration data.
    - **Kernel**: Kernel security keys used for encryption and secure communications.
    - **Android**: Keystore, which securely stores cryptographic keys.

- **Code Segment**:
  - **Purpose**: Contains executable instructions of the program, such as the operating system kernel, device drivers, or user applications.
  - **User Mode**: Can read and execute the code but cannot modify it, ensuring the integrity of the executable code.
  - **Privileged Mode**: Full access, including the ability to modify code, which may be necessary for system updates, patches, or debugging.
  - **Examples**:
    - **UEFI**: UEFI boot code that initializes the system hardware before handing off control to the OS.
    - **Kernel**: Operating system kernel code, including device drivers and core system functions.
    - **Android**: System libraries and executable code that runs within the Android OS environment.

- **Data Segment**:
  - **Purpose**: Stores program data, such as global variables, buffers, and dynamically allocated memory that the program needs to manipulate.
  - **User Mode**: Can read and write data, but execution is not permitted to prevent running potentially harmful code.
  - **Privileged Mode**: Full access, allowing the system to manage all data as needed for both user and system processes.
  - **Examples**:
    - **UEFI**: Global variables used during the boot process.
    - **Kernel**: Heap and stack memory for running processes and managing data structures.
    - **Android**: Application data, temporary buffers, and process-specific memory.


## attack surface
The attack surface for this motivating example consists of two primary components:
-User-Accessible Functions: Functions that handle user inputs and run in user mode with limited permissions. Examples include buffer management functions that process user inputs.
- Privileged Functions: Functions that run with elevated permissions and perform critical system operations. Examples include command execution functions that impact the systemâ€™s overall security.

## threat model
- The attacker can interact with user mode functions but cannot directly access privileged mode functions.
- The attacker can provide inputs to user-accessible functions and exploit vulnerabilities within these functions.
- The system contains multiple vulnerabilities that can be chained together to escalate privileges.

# Project Structure

- user_accessible.c: Contains user-accessible functions.

- testcases/: Directory containing the Juliet test suite.

- example.c: Contains the main function to demonstrate an example of the vulnerability chaining process. 

# Memory Segment Types (MemoryType)

- Data Segment (DATA_SEGMENT):
    - Purpose: Stores global variables, heap data, and other mutable data that a program might need to read from or write to.
    - Access Control:
        - User Mode: Readable and writable, but not executable. 
        - Privileged Mode: Readable, writable, and may have additional privileges for certain operations (e.g., direct memory access).

- Code Segment (CODE_SEGMENT):
    - Purpose: Stores the executable instructions of the program.
    - Access Control:
        - User Mode: Readable and executable, but not writable. 
        - Privileged Mode: Readable, executable, and in some cases writable (e.g., for just-in-time compilation or certain debugging operations). Privileged code might need to modify executable code under specific, controlled circumstances.

- Protected Segment (PROTECTED_SEGMENT):
    - Purpose: Contains sensitive data or commands. 
    - Access Control:
        - User Mode: No access. 
        - Privileged Mode: Readable, and in some cases writable, depending on the specific use case. Only privileged code can access this segment, typically for executing sensitive operations or modifying protected settings.

- Reserved Segment (RESERVED_SEGMENT):
    - Purpose: Reserved for critical system functions or hardware interactions.
    - Access Control:
        - User Mode: No access. 
        - Privileged Mode: Restricted and controlled access.
            - Read: Restricted; only specific low-level operations can read this segment
            - Write: Restricted; only specific system functions or hardware interactions may write to this segment.
            - Execute: Typically not allowed; reserved segments generally do not contain executable code. In very specialized cases, certain low-level operations might execute here.
         

## Memory Segment Access Control Summary

| **Segment Type**        | **User Mode Read** | **User Mode Write** | **User Mode Execute** | **Privileged Mode Read** | **Privileged Mode Write** | **Privileged Mode Execute** |
|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Reserved Segment**     | No                 | No                  | No                    | Restricted                | Restricted                 | Typically No                |
| **Protected Segment**    | No                 | No                  | No                    | Yes                       | Yes (controlled)           | No                          |
| **Code Segment**         | Yes                | No                  | Yes                   | Yes                       | Yes (specific conditions)  | Yes                         |
| **Data Segment**         | Yes                | Yes                 | No                    | Yes                       | Yes                        | No                          |

### Key Points:
- **Reserved Segment**: Highly restricted, used for critical system functions with very limited access, even in privileged mode.
- **Protected Segment**: No access in user mode; controlled read and write access in privileged mode, typically for sensitive data.
- **Code Segment**: Readable and executable in both modes, but writable only in privileged mode under specific conditions to maintain the integrity of executable code.
- **Data Segment**: Fully accessible for reading and writing in both modes, but not executable to prevent running arbitrary data as code.

# Juliet Test Suite for C/C++

This is the Juliet Test Suite for C/C++ version 1.3 from https://samate.nist.gov/SARD/testsuite.php augmented with a build system for Unix-like OSes that supports automatically building test cases into individual executables and running those tests. The build system originally provided with the test suite supports building all test cases for a particular [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/) into a monolithic executable. Building individual test cases supports the evaluation of projects like [CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/) that facilitate memory safety for C/C++ programs at runtime. 

Testcases are organized by CWE in the `testcases` subdirectory. `juliet.py` is the main script that supports building and running individual test cases - individual CWEs or the entire test suite can be targeted. To build executables, `juliet.py` copies `CMakeLists.txt` into the directories for targeted CWEs and runs cmake followed by make. Output appears by default in a `bin` subdirectory. Each targeted CWE has a `bin/CWEXXX` directory that is further divided into `bin/CWEXXX/good` and `bin/CWEXXX/bad` subdirectories. For each test case, a "good" binary that does not contain the error is built and placed into the good subdirectory and a "bad" binary that contains the error is built and placed into the bad subdirectory.

To run executables after they are built, `juliet.py` invokes the `juliet-run.sh` script, which is copied to the `bin` subdirectory during the build. It records exit codes in `bin/CWEXXX/good.run` and `bin/CWEXXX/bad.run`. Executables are run with a timeout so that test cases depending on user input timeout with exit code 124.

**Note:** Juliet C++ test cases that use namespace std and the bind() socket function didn't compile under c++11, which introduces std::bind(). This version of the test suite has replaced `bind()` calls in C++ source files with calls to `::bind()`.

## Running tests on CheriBSD

TODO

To run the tests on CHERI you can use [cheribuild](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribuild):
`cheribuild.py juliet-c-cheri --build-and-test` will build and run the tests (assuming you have built the SDK and a CheriBSD image first).

You can also manually mount the built `bin` subdirectory on a CheriBSD host and use the `juliet-run.sh` script directly to run tests.
